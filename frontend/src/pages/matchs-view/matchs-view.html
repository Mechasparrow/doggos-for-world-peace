The overwhelming majority of our users are trustworthy and well-meaning. All caretakers are background-checked and vetted by our staff. But however unlikely the risks may be, please take use common sense precautions when using our service.
Meet a caretaker before entrusting your pet to them, and vice versa. Meet in a public place and tell someone where you're going.
Trust your instincts. If you wouldn't entrust a family member to them, then don't entrust your pet. You can always find another caretaker.
If you encounter any issues with a user of our service, please report them so we can ensure the safety of all of our users and their pets.
